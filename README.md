# Environmental_Motivated_Animated_Visuals
In this R-Script, we create 3+1 animated graphs grasping motivation from Environmental Concerns.
Firstly, we collect data from the Greek Ministry of Energy about the amount of electricity produced by different sources during the first five months of 2021.
Then, we move our focus to Denmark, where we firstly create an animated graph for the Average Temperature of Denmark since 1900. Furthermore, we examine
the CO2 Emissions of Denmark separately in two cases. Ininitially, we observe the CO2 Emissions without counting the emissions derived from Biomass, and then 
count Biomass impact on CO2 Emissions in order to check for the difference, and to emphasize that Biomass emissions are not something to overlook or
underestimate. Finally, we are getting slightly out of the context, and we present a very interesting animated graph comparing GDP vs Life Expectancy in countries
with varied population and from many different continetns.
